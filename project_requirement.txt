Goal
Design and implement a prototype of a conversational AI coach that can support entrepreneurs by answering business-related questions, giving motivational nudges, and helping the user take actionable steps forward.

Scenario
You're developing Anna, the AI coach for first-time entrepreneurs. The coach needs to sound helpful, be able to answer basic business questions, and guide users through their early steps.

Task
Build a prototype of a conversational agent that can:
Answer entrepreneurship-related questions (e.g. “How do I validate my idea?”).
Ask the user goal-oriented follow-up questions (e.g. “Who’s your target customer?”).
Based on this, provide actionable coaching (e.g. "Since you haven't yet defined your target customer, I suggest we get this done by ...")
Use a local knowledge base or provide live search integration to improve responses.
Log interactions and reflect basic reasoning behind the AI's decisions (e.g. "I'm asking this because...").

Requirements
Use Python (or your preferred language) with relevant NLP/LLM tools.
Any LLM of your choice
Any knowledge base of your choice
You may use LangChain, LangGraph, RAG techniques, or equivalent frameworks.
You can simulate user input/output via CLI, simple web UI, or notebook.
Deploy it wherever you prefer, that is publicly available to us to view and test

Bonuses
Clear prompt engineering strategy/reasoning.
Creative use of retrieval techniques (e.g. embedding knowledge).
Integration with external APIs or tools (e.g. search, WhatsApp, Discord).
Modular design & thoughtful edge-case handling.
Reasoning or reflection layer (basic self-debugging or transparency).
Any other surprises we haven't expected!

Deliverables
Source code (well-commented) (Github repo link)
Link to deployed app
Brief write-up (1 page max):
Architecture overview
Design decisions and trade-offs
Ideas for improvement if you had more time
(Optional) Demo video or notebook walkthrough

Time Limit
Aim to spend not more than 1 full day max (6-8h). Don’t over-polish it or overthink — we value your thought process more than a perfect system. Once the test is completed, please send it to us at least 24h before our meet, so we have time to review.

Converstation between me and clients

me : From which data our agent will give answer like from web search data or LLL knowledge or our own custom data store somewhere. 
client : Or perhaps a combination of the options mentioned? I’ll leave that for you to decide, show us your agency and problem solving skills!
